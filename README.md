# The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker 3D
A 3DS remake of Wind Waker.<br>
Originally developed for the Nintendo DS, essayharper moved development to the 3DS.<br>
We're trying to be as close to the original as possible, just note that we don't have access to the original source code.<br>
# Building Info 
First install the devkitARM toolchains and 3DS libraries on you system.<br>
Here is a installation guide: [Click here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).<br>
Then run the Makefile....For Windows you probably need WSL.<br>
You will obtain the .3dsx version of WW3D, for the .cia version you need makerom.<br>
