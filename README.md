## History
Originally developed for the Nintendo DS, essayharper moved development to the 3DS.<br>
We're trying to be as close to the original as possible, just note that we don't have access to the original source code.<br> 
Despite essayharper's limited knowledge about the inner workings of the Gamecube version.<br>
